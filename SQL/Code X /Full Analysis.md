## Step 1: Introduction:
Dhavel Patel and his partner Hemanand Vadivel, founders or E-learning platform, code basics, partner up to create different challeneges that aspiring analysts can use to practice and develop their analytical skills to help them become a better data analyts.

The dataset can be found on their main website here [Codebasic.io](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).

The datasets that are included in the challenege are 3 CSV files:

### Methodology:

The datasets were downloaded to Google's Big Query cloud platform for data cleaning/exlploration and then transfered to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard illustrating the main findings from my analysis.

## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory in SQL:
#### Data Cleaning Process:
Prior to analyzing the data, I noticed that column duration has shifted to ratings column for show_id s5542, s5795, and s5814 so I shifted them to the correct column in excel.

Notebook:

1.)	Early part of data exploratory I wanted to know the amount of data that I am working with and then showing then breaking it down further by showing the total number of Movies and TV shows that are contained in the dataset.

2.)	To show what contents are available in different countries, I wanted to first see what countries the biggest film producers.

2a.) I then wanted to see which TV/Movie Ratings were most common throughout the dataset.

2b.) I then took the Top 3 countries (US, India, and United Kingdom) and compared what TV/Movie ratings were available in each country.

3.)	To look at the network relationship between directors and cast members, I first looked at which director has produced the most films in the dataset.

3b.) For the next step I looked at the top 5 producing directors and see which cast were associated with their movies/TV shows

3c.) For extra analysis, I took the most frequent network connection between the director and cast member(s) and looked at what type of film they produced the most.
