### About the data
For this project, data was extracted from Kaggle.com that contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies from 1980 to 2017. The dataset contains video games sales across different platforms, genres, publishers, and regions around the globe. Data exploratory analysis was performed to discover key insights and identify patterns about the sales of different video games.

###  Methodology
The dataset was originally downloaded as a CSV file but then translated to MySQL where I then created a database and performed exploratory analysis. After discovering important findings and conclusions, I transferred the data into Power BI to create an interactive and detailed visualization.
